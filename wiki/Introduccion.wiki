= What is Core9? =

Some time ago I was creating some web applications from scratch (I've never been such a friend of frameworks like CakePHP or Symphony) and I felt that I needed some way to have common code (module loaders, models and templates) prepared and ready to build anything at any time. Thus Core was born.

Time passed and versions went (primarily for my own use) until I went in a full rewrite dubbed Core9. This rewrite focused in OOP and went closer and closer to the MVC architecture in each version. And this is what you have now here.

Core9 is a simple framework designed to build quick applications. Just drop some controllers, models and templates and you're set. It features some libraries built-in (nuSOAP for Webservices, mooTools for JavaScript goodness and Bootstrap CSS for UI greatness, among others) and the code is simple and clean to let you modify anything you need. You can use Core9 as a kickstart for your application and then modify it as your needs change.

= How does it work? =

Core9 is quite organized and has some different parts:

# The Core class set
# Controllers
# Models
# Views
# Stylesheets
# JavaScript files
# Webservice APIs
