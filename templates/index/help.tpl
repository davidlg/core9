	<h1>Ouch! This isn't quite configured yet!</h1>
	
	<p>
	Okay, so this is what happened: Core9 is working properly but it's <em>not so properly configured</em>. Please, pay a visit to
	<em>config/config.inc.php</em> and adjust any configuration you may need to, specially the <strong>APP_PATH</strong> and
	<strong>APP_URL</strong> ones.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We will put here more information about how to configure Core9 in next versions. Right now, this is everything I can say!
